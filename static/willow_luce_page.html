    This cultist is enthusiastically trying to recruit new cultists. She's a little too chipper and a little too helpful, like Jehovah's Witnesses or Mormons. She's not brainwashed -  she's genuinely fairly happy being in the cult and with the community that it's provided for her. That community just happens to be focused around worshipping and carrying out the will of a real elder god that wants to make the world theirs
