    This stern, humorless doctor takes her work very seriously. She sees most people as obstacles who are likely to get in his way. She travels with 1d3 guards. Initially, her attitude towards people will be to scorn and mistrust them, but as she opens up, she'll feel more comfortable asking for help and providing healing or healing supplies.
