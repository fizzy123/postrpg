    The assassin's guild is something like a worker's union for assassins that's designed to create systems of mutual support and benefit. Without this kind of system, assassins are simply incetivized to target each other to minimize their competition. However, with the assassin's guild, dues are collected and used to make and establish improvements that benefit all assassins in the assassin's guild. These benefits include pension plans, protection plans, client management and communication, clean up services, supplier deals, etc. Their primgary goals are maximize money made and minimize assassins killed.
