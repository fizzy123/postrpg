    Bandits make their living attacking and stealing from who-ever they can in the wilderness. They might simply attack you, or they might have a more clever plan. If players encounter a bandit, consider coming up with something more clever than simply attacking them. Maybe one of the bandits pretends to be hurt and tricks someone into getting close and putting their guard down. Maybe a bandit leads the party into an ambush.
