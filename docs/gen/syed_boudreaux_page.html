    This good spirited bard is actually a lich, who is using his songs to get humans to generate magical energy for him. However, he's not interested in being exploitive. He wants to use this magical energy to give back to his fans, make incredible music and performances, and achieve his artistic dreams. The typical lich stuff is a little like how alcohol is to a recovering alcoholic - he's tempted by it, but he knows it could ruin his goals
