    A cult that genuinely believes that a benevolent dictatorship by their elder god is the best way to make the world a better place. Despite the fact that they are literally cultists, they encourage extremely healthy communication and work life balance. Using the mechanism of shame is deeply frowned upon, while compromise, vulnerability, and validation are highly prioritized. They can be found collecting relics of power to enable their god to have a greater foothold on this reality, destroying magical seals that keep their god from being able to enter this reality and also doing generally wholesome things like bake sales, bingo nights, and charity drives to both raise money for their cult-y activites and also encouraging recruitment.
