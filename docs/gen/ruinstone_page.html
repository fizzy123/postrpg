    Once per day as a bonus action, a villain can activate the ruinstone to undo one deed they have performed. The possibilities here are broad, but in combat it's simplest to allow them the opportunity to "rewind" one action and take it again, or to reroll a failed saving throw (if it can still take actions).

Each use of the artifact has a terrible side effect: someone known to the wielder is also erased from reality. https://5e.tools/items.html#ruinstone_dc
