    This fun, easygoing paladin can frequently be found in a good mood, mostly because he thinks he's better than others and because he believes that he has that power and authority to do whatever he wants. He expects others to defer to his authority and will get upset when they don't. Zain is a fairly simple person. He just wants to feel powerful as often as he can, whether that's in combat or by enforcing his power over others.
