    A ghost is the soul of a once-living creature, bound to haunt a specific location, creature, or object that held significance to it in its life. It often can't move on because of unresolved trauma and will lash out at things around whatever it's haunting. A ghost can be fought directly, but can also be banished by resolving it's unfinished business, which might involve transporting something, killing someone, or destroying something. https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ghost
