    Inside this heavy cloth bag are 3d4 dry beans. The bag weighs ½ pound plus ¼ pound for each bean it contains. If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The DM can choose an effect from the following table, determine it randomly, or create an effect. https://5e.tools/items.html#bag%20of%20beans_dmg
