    A shambling mound, sometimes called a shambler, trudges ponderously through bleak swamps, dismal marshes, and rain forests, consuming any organic matter in its path. This rotting heap of animated vegetation looms up half again as tall as a human, tapering into a faceless “head” at its top. A shambling mouond is omnivorous and will just walk around trying to find whatever it can eat. It is not necessarily violent but will defend itself from danger. https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/shambling-mound
