    Skeletons are magically re-animated skeletons. They have no wills of their own and no semblance of who they were before. Skeletons will simply pursue whatever goal they were reanimated with - which is usally to fight, but sometimes skeletons are reanimated with different goals, like building things, transporting things, etc.
