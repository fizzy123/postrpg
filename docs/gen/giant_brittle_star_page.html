    This creature has a small star-shaped body covered in armor, and five long spiny tendrils. It has no apparent eyes, but acts as if it can see perfectly well.

Giant brittle stars live along the waterâ€™s edge. Unlike their mundane kin, they are carnivorous, but their small mouths mean that they have to tear prey to tiny pieces in order to ingest it. Their spiked arms can accomplish this task suitably, and their armored exoskeleton deters attackers long enough to make their assault. Horrifyingly, a giant brittle star can detach its arms, which can slither away or fight on their own. It usually uses this ability when surrounded or overwhelmed, and may attempt to escape and leave behind an arm as a decoy. https://thecreaturecodex.tumblr.com/post/645677912393187328/brittle-star-giant
