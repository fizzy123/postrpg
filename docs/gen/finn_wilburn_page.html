    This young introverted necromancer is more comfortable around bodies than they are around people. They care about their re-animations more than they care about most people. They usually have a few re-animations with them. They're often looking for new bodies to turn into friends and will be overjoyed if you bring a fresh body to them. They're also often trying to avoid danger or crowded areas. They've found that people are weirded out by his posse and will kill them.
