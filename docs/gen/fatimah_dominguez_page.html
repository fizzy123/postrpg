She does no assassinating on her own, but is under heavy protection within the guild. Her personality is confident and stern, but not humorless. She cares for her reports deeply, but has high expectations of them and has no problem pushing them to do their best. She usually acts with the goal of making the Assassin's Guild as efficient as possible.
