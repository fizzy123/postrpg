    This character is actually a spy from a competing country trying to uncover and infiltrate imperialist operations. They'll lie about who they are and what they're doing and it'll be comically transparent. The DM should hastily make up a new persona for them each time they're encountered. Despite their complete lack of ability, they are extremely overconfident in their ability as a spy.
