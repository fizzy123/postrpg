    lake
    </div>
    <div>
    A body of water large enough that you can't see the whole thing, but you can see the other side and can tell it's not a sea or ocean. A lake might contain some larger aquantic animals and monsters, as well as some more valuable/larger trinkets at the bottom, Maybe there's an island in the middle. Maybe someone is stuck on the lake.
