    This cultist is enthusiastically trying to recruit new cultists. She's a little too chipper and a little too helpful, like Jehovah's Witnesses or Mormons. She's not brainwashed -  she's genuinely fairly happy being in the cult and with the community that it's provided for her. She'll always be super friendly to you whenever you encounter her, as well as be eager to help with whatever it is that you're trying to do. If you encounter her in the wild, she's almost always either on her way to help out with a wholesome charity event or on her way to help out with a ritual that will punch a hole in the fabric of reality and allow the power of her dark lord to leak through.
