    This adventurer has identical stats and skills as a character in your party. They are that character's rival. Their entire life is besting that character and they get a little hurt when the players disregard them. Their entire identity is based on being better than this other person. When players first encounter this character, they'll start chill, but as they realize their similarites, they'll start passively trying to one up them as often as they can.
