    This character is a brain in a jar. I am going to write a backstory and personality for this character. The undead horrors known as brains in a jar are simultaneously incredibly powerful and incredibly feeble. Their mental prowess is superior to that of any but the most gifted mortal, and their wide array of magical and psychic powers allow them to wither the bodies and minds of their enemies. Their corporeal forms, however, are limited to a barely motile brain encased in a jar of fluid. Although they can move and protect this jar with their psychic powers, they are extremely weak and relatively fragile. This dichotomy drives many brains in a jar to build a host of thralls, both mortal and undead, to protect them and distract their enemies. https://thecreaturecodex.tumblr.com/post/153867127450/brain-in-a-jar
