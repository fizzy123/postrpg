    This duchess might appear dull-witted and vapid, but this is all a front that she puts on as the leader of the Assasin's Guild. She uses her political position and social know-how in order to.have targets murdered without doing any dirty work. Others can rarely tell what her true feelings or intentions are. She honestly cares for the people beneath her and cares primarily about protecting and advocating for her guild and her people. If she had to choose one or the other, however, she's probably more partial to the guild, which she built from the ground up
