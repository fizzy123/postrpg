    This creature is a collection of plant matter grown in the shape of a humanoid, walking on fibrous tendrils and with a stalk for a neck. Its head is a set of jaw, like the mouth of a Venus flytrap but much bigger. Its vine-like arms grow around a polearm.

Flytrap soldiers are carnivorous plants crafted through magic to serve as steadfast and replaceable troops. https://thecreaturecodex.tumblr.com/post/644500184624136192/flytrap-soldier
