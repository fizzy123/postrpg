    <div>
    some random fighter or group of fighter's that's traveling. they likely have no explicit reason to fight you, but if they start to percieve you as a threat, they're likely to attack. They probably have some melee fighters, some archers, and some magic users. Feel free (as DM) to vary how a group of fighters is made up.
