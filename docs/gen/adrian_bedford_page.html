    This traveling clown is the saddest person the adventurers will meet on their journey. He's poor, completely helpless, and universally hated for no good reason. He has no charisma and most NPCs will either hate him or pity him. DM shouold come up with comically sad experiences for the clown to have just had. He just wants to travel and make people laugh.
